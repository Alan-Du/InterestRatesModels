Interest Rates Models
===================

This repository holds plugins implementing several interest rate models:

-Hull And White One Factor: A no-arbitrage model which is the industry standard for modeling the future interest rate dynamic.

-Pelsser's squared gaussian model: A no-arbitrage model which ensures positive interest rates realizations.
